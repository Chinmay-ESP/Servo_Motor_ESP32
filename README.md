# ESP32 Servo Motor Control Using MCPWM (ESP-IDF)

This repository contains a project to control a servo motor using the ESP32's Motor Control PWM (MCPWM) peripheral with the ESP-IDF framework. The servo motor's position is determined by the duty cycle of the PWM signal, which is configured and generated by the ESP32.

## Features
- **Precise Servo Control:** Uses the MCPWM peripheral for accurate PWM signal generation.
- **Configurable Parameters:** Easily adjust the PWM frequency, duty cycle, and control pin.
- **Efficient Framework:** Built using ESP-IDF for robust and reliable performance.
- **Scalable Design:** Easily adapt to multiple servo motors.

## Hardware Requirements
- **ESP32 Development Board**
- **Servo Motor (e.g., SG90, MG996R)**
- **Power Supply for Servo Motor** (Ensure proper power as servos typically need 5V/6V)
- **Connecting Wires**

## Circuit Diagram
1. Connect the **control pin** of the servo motor to the specified GPIO 32 on the ESP32.
2. Provide external power (5V) to the servo motor.
3. Commonly connect the ground (GND) of the ESP32 and the servo motor power supply.

| Servo Motor Pin  | Connection                    |
|-------------------|-------------------------------|
| **VCC**          | External 5V Power Supply      |
| **GND**          | ESP32 GND and Power GND       |
| **Control Pin**   | ESP32 GPIO 23    |
